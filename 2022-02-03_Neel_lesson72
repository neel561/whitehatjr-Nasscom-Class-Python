Create a function `quickSort` that takes three inputs as follows: \n","\n","  - `array` - The array to be sorted\n","\n","  - `left` - first index of the array\n","\n","  - `right` - last index of the array\n","\n","2. Define the condition for recursion to break by checking whether `left < right`.\n","\n","3. Call the `partition` function to put the pivot element selected at its right position. \n","\n","**Note**: Select the first element as a pivot and the partition function will always put the first element at its right location in our implementation. \n"," "]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"LZE88Ys4D5eh","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1643863674737,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":443,"user":{"displayName":"Neel Borse","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ggni5M244Fm8fQQRRdJ8FtYyRSIyQ2EaWx9ElUuUg=s64","userId":"12762889080856890355"}}},"source":[" #T3.2:  Function to do Quick sort \n","\n","def quickSort(arr,left,right): \n","  if left<right: #Condition to break for recurssion\n","    pivot_location=partition(array,left,right) # Pivot location\n","    quickSort(array,left,pivot_location-1) # Apply quick sort on left array\n","    quickSort(array,pivot_location+1,right) # Apply quick sort on right array\n","\n"],"execution_count":9,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nf5Od94dcT7v"},"source":["Now let's try to sort an array using the quick sort technique that we have created."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"jb0ytgcOnPBN","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1643863712372,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":534,"user":{"displayName":"Neel Borse","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ggni5M244Fm8fQQRRdJ8FtYyRSIyQ2EaWx9ElUuUg=s64","userId":"12762889080856890355"}},"outputId":"d28d4407-e4fa-45ac-96af-e564e1ccb7a2"},"source":["#S3.1: Implement quicksort on this array\n","\n","array = [5, 3, 4, 2, 1] \n","quickSort(array,0,len(array)-1) \n","print (\"Sorted array is:\") \n","print(array)"],"execution_count":10,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Sorted array is:\n","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"VxIy0DySd9Aq"},"source":["**Q:** Will our implementation work if the random element is selected as a pivot?\n","\n","**A:** Yes."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ms-yrJadeVys"},"source":["**Q:** Which sorting algorithm is implemented in the Python sort function?\n","\n","**A:** Quick Sort."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_yy8mjL9yRSd"},"source":["Hence, we have learned all the sorting algorithms that are crucial in Data Structures.
