No wonder Python is leading in data visualization as well. In addition to Matplotlib and Seaborn, Python has a variety of rich set of libraries such as Bokeh, Plotly, Pygal, Altair, Geoplotlib to perform data visualisation.\n","\n","In today's class, we will explore these visualisation tools and will also get acquainted with a very famous data visualisation tool called Tableau."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3RWIgslVpP0Z"},"source":["---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZVO8QHPp_UGs"},"source":["#### Introduction to Tableau \n","\n","\n","Tableau is a powerful and fastest growing data visualization tool used in the business intelligence industry. It helps in simplifying raw data in a very easily understandable format. Tableau helps create the data that can be understood by professionals at any level in an organization. It also allows non-technical users to create customized dashboards.\n","\n","Data analysis is very fast with Tableau tool and the visualizations created are in the form of dashboards and worksheets.\n","\n","The best features of Tableau software are:\n","\n","**1. Data Blending:** Data blending is the most important feature in Tableau. It is used when we combine related data from multiple data sources, which you want to analyze together in a single view, and represent in the form of a graph.\n","\n","**2. Real time analysis:** Real-Time Analysis allows users to quickly understand and analyze dynamic data, when the real-time analysis of data is complicated. Tableau can help extract valuable information from fast moving data with interactive analytics.\n","\n","**3. Collaboration of data:** Data analysis is not an isolating task. That's why Tableau is built for collaboration. Team members can share data, make follow up queries, and forward easy-to-digest visualizations to others who could gain value from the data.\n","\n","The great thing about Tableau software is that it doesn't require any technical or any kind of programming skills to operate. The tool has garnered interest among the people from all sectors such as business, researchers, different industries, etc.\n","\n","All these reasons to use Tableau are going to make much more sense when we go about practically learning it.

Task 4: Altair\n","\n","\n","Altair is an open-source Python library used for declarative statistical visualization and is based on Vega and Vega-Lite. Altair creates highly interactive and informative visualizations so that we can spend more time understanding the data we are using and its meaning.\n","\n","Altair’s is simple, easy to use, and consistent because it is built on top of the powerful Vega-Lite visualization grammar. It produces beautiful and effective visualizations with a minimal amount of code. The visualizations produced can be downloaded in different formats and can be manipulated using different parameters.\n","\n","The following command can be used to install Altair like any other Python library:\n","\n","`!pip install --upgrade altair`\n","\n","We are going to use datasets from the `vega_datasets` package. To install, the following command should be employed:\n","\n","`pip install vega_datasets`\n","\n","**Essential elements of an Altair chart:**\n","\n","All Altair charts need three essential elements: Data, Mark, and Encoding. A valid chart can also be made by specifying only the data and mark.\n","\n","The basic format of all altair chart is:\n","\n","1. Make a chart. \n","2. Pass in some data. \n","3. Specify the type of mark you want. \n","4. Specify the encoding.\n","\n","```python\n","alt.Chart(data).mark_bar().encode( \n","       encoding1 = 'column1', \n","       encoding2 = 'column2', \n","\n",")\n","```\n","\n","\n","Let us visualize the iris dataset from the `vega_datasets` library in the form of a scatter plot. \n","\n","The mark method used for the scatter plot in this example is `mark_point()`. For this bi-variate analysis, we map the `sepalLength` and `petalLength` columns to the `x` and `y` axes encoding. Further, to differentiate the points from each other, we map the shape encoding to the species column. \n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ezLrC0Euho3U","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":367},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1644639733412,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":542,"user":{"displayName":"Neel Borse","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Ggni5M244Fm8fQQRRdJ8FtYyRSIyQ2EaWx9ElUuUg=s64","userId":"12762889080856890355"}},"outputId":"490e02d3-905f-41e4-b2c6-6a15ae0ed850"},"source":["# S4.1: Create scatter plot using 'altair' library.\n","# Importing altair\n","import altair as alt\n","from vega_datasets import data\n","i = data.iris()\n","alt.Chart(i).mark_point().encode(x= 'sepalLength',y = 'petalLength',shape ='species')\n","# Import data object from vega_datasets\n","\n","\n","# Selecting the data\n","\n","\n","# Making the Scatter Plot\n","\n","\t# Map the sepalLength to x-axis\n","\n","\t# Map the petalLength to y-axis\n","\n","\t# Map the species to shape\n","\n"],"execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["alt.Chart(...)"],"text/html":["\n","<div id=\"altair-viz-1e48e06b64334b3e91250777ba0f3b49\"></div>\n","<script type=\"text/javascript\">\n","  var VEGA_DEBUG = (typeof VEGA_DEBUG == \"undefined\") ? {} : VEGA_DEBUG;\n","  (function(spec, embedOpt){\n","    let outputDiv = document.currentScript.previousElementSibling;\n","    if (outputDiv.id !== \"altair-viz-1e48e06b64334b3e91250777ba0f3b49\") {\n","      outputDiv = document.getElementById(\"altair-viz-1e48e06b64334b3e91250777ba0f3b49\");\n","    }\n","    const paths = {\n","      \"vega\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm//vega@5?noext\",\n","      \"vega-lib\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm//vega-lib?noext\",\n","      \"vega-lite\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm//vega-lite@4.17.0?noext\",\n","      \"vega-embed\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm//vega-embed@6?noext\",\n","    };\n","\n","    function maybeLoadScript(lib, version) {\n","      var key = `${lib.replace(\"-\", \"\")}_version`;\n","      return (VEGA_DEBUG[key] == version) ?\n","        Promise.resolve(paths[lib]) :\n","        new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n","          var s = document.createElement('script');\n","          document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0].appendChild(s);\n","          s.async = true;\n","          s.onload = () => {\n","            VEGA_DEBUG[key] = version;\n","            return resolve(paths[lib]);\n","          };\n","          s.onerror = () => reject(`Error loading script: ${paths[lib]}`);\n","          s.src = paths[lib];\n","        });\n","    }\n","\n","    function showError(err) {\n","      outputDiv.innerHTML = `<div class=\"error\" style=\"color:red;\">${err}</div>`;\n","      throw err;\n","    }\n","\n","    function displayChart(vegaEmbed) {\n","      vegaEmbed(outputDiv, spec, embedOpt)\n","        .catch(err => showError(`Javascript Error: ${err.message}<br>This usually means there's a typo in your chart specification.
