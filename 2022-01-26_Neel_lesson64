At times, we think about the question, how exactly the data is stored in the backend and retrieved back in the same format. The answer to this is **Data Structures**.\n","\n","A data structure is a way to organize and store data in the computer. It helps you to understand the relationship of one data element with the other and organize it within the memory. \n","\n","**Advantages of Data Structures:**\n","1. A data structure will give the knowledge about the organization of data. \n","2. It tells you how to design the structure of the data, control the flow of data, implement the structure to reduce the complexity, and increase the efficacy of the algorithm.\n","\n","\n","For example:\n","\n","1.

Essentially, it happens when the current value has the data as well as the address of the next value.\n","\n","> The sequential data makes the relation linear.
