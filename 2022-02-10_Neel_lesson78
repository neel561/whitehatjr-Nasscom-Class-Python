A database can be of any size and complexity.\n","\n","Traditionally, to store information **file processing systems** were used where for every function a specific file was create. For example, for a school management system, \n","- One file was created for student's academic information about classes, grades, etc. \n","- Another file was created for student's accounting information about fees and payments from students.\n","\n","Both the files were maintained separately, hence if the information of the student, e.g. student's phone number,  need to be updated then both files need to be updated accordingly. The mainteinance of this system may result in a lot of issues like: \n","- **Data Redundancy:** Same data may be duplicated in multiple files which takes up more disc space.\n","- **Data Inconsistency:** Due to data redundancy, the same data stored in multiple files may not match with each other thereby causing inconsistency in data.\n","- **Expensive Storage:** Duplicate data also leads to wastage of space and high storage and access cost.\n","\n","This lead to the development of **DBMS**.
