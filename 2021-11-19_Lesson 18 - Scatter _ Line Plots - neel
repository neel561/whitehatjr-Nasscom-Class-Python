We also learned how to create Pandas DataFrames, how to find the number of rows and columns in a DataFrame, how to check for the missing values, and how to slice a DataFrame using the `iloc[]` function. \n","\n","In this class, we will create **scatter plots** and **line plots** to visualize the fluctuations in the brightness levels (or flux values) of the light emitted by the stars.\n","\n","- If there is a periodic dip in the brightness levels, then we can say that the star has at least one planet. This star is labeled as `2`.\n","\n","-  If there is no clear periodic dip in the brightness levels, then we could say that the star has no planet. In the datasets, such stars are labeled as `1`.\n","\n","The `exo_train_df` has 5087 rows and 3198 columns. Each row denotes a star. The `LABEL` column tells the label or the classification of the star, i.e., whether it has at least one planet or at most one planet. The remaining 3197 columns, i.e., the columns `FLUX.1` to `FLUX.3197` contain the brightness levels for each star. A brightness level is a floating-point value that could be either positive, negative, or zero. *For the time being, do not worry about the negative brightness levels.*\n","\n","We will create the scatter plots and line plots for three stars labeled as `2` and three stars labeled as `1`.\n","\n","As far as data analysis is concerned, you do not have to create a DataFrame for the test dataset. So, in this lesson, we will not create a DataFrame for the `exoTest.csv` file.\n","\n","Let's run all the codes in the code cells that we have already covered in the previous class (*Learned in Lesson: Pandas DataFrame*) and begin this class from the **Task 1: Scatter And Line Plots For First 3 Stars** section. You too run the code cells until the first activity.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eq9mAtEg9cpZ"},"source":["---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OwzryU6Zie33"},"source":["#### Loading the Training Dataset\n","\n","Dataset links (Don't click on them):\n","\n","1.
