Why?\n","\n","Recall that in the case of the string concatenation, we have to use the `+` operator several times to get one string. Additionally, you have to beware of spaces and also have to convert a non-string data type object to a string before concatenation. This is such a big hassle if too many strings are to be concatenated.\n","\n","Similarly, while printing the values of multiple entities using the `print()` function, you have to separate them with commas. Again quite a handful of  tasks especially in the case of long strings.\n","\n","The `format()` function doesn't require that much effort to generate a clean string. It allows you to create one long string with proper punctuation and plug in the required values at the respective places in the long string.\n","\n","Let's learn this function with the help of an example. We have a dummy CSV containing the data of the 20 professional marathon runners (men's category) who participated in the **Mumbai Marathon (TMM)** 2020.\n","\n","Our task is to create a certificate for each runner using the `format()` function. The certificate should read the following:\n","\n","```\n","Mumbai Marathon 2020\n","\n","      CONGRATULATIONS\n","\n","This is to certify that JOHN DERA                     \n","BIB No. 22\n","officially completed the marathon \n","(distance 42.2 km) \n","in the men's category \n","with a finish time of 2:08:09 \n","and rank 1.                   \n","--------------------------------------------------\n","```\n","\n","Here's the link to the CSV file containing data for each runner:\n","\n","\n","https://s3-whjr-curriculum-uploads.whjr.online/0da95234-a814-4957-b949-38d4b7754a94.csv\n","\n","**Note:** This is a dummy dataset used for the sole purpose of understanding the concept. \n","\n","\n","**How to approach this task?**\n","\n","1. Create a Pandas DataFrame for the MM 2020 professional runners (men's category).\n","\n","2.
